    <h3>History</h3>
    <blockquote>Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 by an ex-Mushi production staff Hideyaki Hatta. In 2003, it began its independent production with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu, In 2006, it produced the famous Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu and reached the verge of its fame earning an international enthusiasm known as Haruhism for outstanding art quality, characteristic cinematography and absorbing characters. However, Kyoto Animation faces a downfall after its release of second season that included: “Endless Eight” a repetition of identical 8 episodes. This unfathomable course of action was condemned by the fans. What saved Kyoto Animation was the best-selling Slice of Life anime: K-ON! and the movie Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu in 2010 that was praised by the critics and the fans. In 2012, it produced Chunnibyo demo Koi ga Shitai! and Hyouka leaving some decent outcomes both commercially and artistically. These animes regained Kyoto Animation’s status in the industry. In 2013, it produced its first practical original anime Tamako Market and Free! that left one of the highest sales in recent animes by Kyoto Animation. In 2014, it released the movie Tamako Love Story that was well received by both critics and the public. In 2016, it has announced to produce an adaptation of famous manga series: “Koe no Katachi”"</blockquote>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <blockquote>Greatest merit of Kyoto Animation is its cutting-edge art. Nowadays, its art quality is not as dominant as it used to be due to overall advancement of quality in anime industry, but it still is one of the companies that is never left out when speaking of quality of art in anime. It mostly uses bright and clear colour composition and soft lines. Kyoto Animation is also well-known for its character design that demonstrates the essence of the character’s identity. Notably, unlike other productions, Kyoto Animation produced many adaptations of minor works. Currently, it owns its only light novel publishing label KA Esuma Bunko for a steady supply of stories for anime. Namely, Lucky Star and K-ON! which were minor works became major sellers after the release of the anime. In terms of film work, Kyoto Animation is specialized in presenting natural everyday movements and gag scenes. Kyoto Animation tries to have a high quality of background music and records the music using analog instruments. They often use classic in their works as well. Its major fields are Slice of Life and School animes where they’ve shown a great quality of works. It is an inspiring production.</blockquote>

As the studio is a part of Sony, some products are labelled by Sony when released or transferred to different platform such as PSP.</blockquote>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <blockquote>A-1 Pictures does not have a fixed production staff. Hence, it generally is in charge of production management rather than creation of anime itself. For this reason, the style and art of the anime tends to change depending on which staff took part of the production process. After 2012, the general quality of anime declined as the production began producing excessive amount of works per quarter. Namely, Magi and Black Butler Season 2 was heavily criticized by original fans for its bad adaptation and recreation of the work. Production produced many commercially successful and famous works including Sword Art Online, The Idolm@ster, WORKING!, The Deadly Seven Sins. Most notably, Ano hi mita hana no namae wo bokutachi wa mada shiranai is one of their major works. It has produced numerous masterpieces for Noitanima such as Boku dake ga Inai Machi, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Ano Hana as mentioned above.</blockquote>

It was a company that mostly produced OVAs, but in 1994 produced its first TVA and concentrated on making TV series ever since. In 2002, they released Azumanga Doioh! which still holds the highest sales record of the studio. In 2005, it started producing anime adaptation of popular light novels such as Shakugan no Shana and became a major production. In 2008, it produced Toradora and To aru Majutsu no Index which drew significant attention at the time. However, in 2011, Season 2 of To aru Majutsu no Index was criticized for unsatisfying art quality and story-telling. In 2015, it produced ecchi genres including Prison School and Shokugeki no Souma.</blockquote>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <blockquote>J.C.STAFF focuses on producing animes with a constant and stable level of quality rather than aiming for creating a very high-quality contents. It usually produces excessive amount of works per year which has led to declining quality of work and original elements adopted into animes which were often not welcomed by original fans. Namely, To aru Kagaku no Railgun Season 2 terribly received by original fans for almost creating a parallel world compared to the novel. Largest problem is action. It didn’t show any significant development in Shakugan no Shana, To aru Majutus no Index and Ookami-san to Shichijin no Nakama-tachi. It’s specialized in drama and produced many great works such as Dodame Cantabile, Toradora and Bakuman. Recently, it seemed to explore a new genre by producing ecchi works including Shokugeki no Souma and Prison School as noted above.</blockquote>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <blockquote>Shaft was established in 1975 and has a long history. However, it worked as a subcontractor for two decades. Before 2009, it produced Hidamari Sketch and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and pioneered its unique genre, but wasn’t able to achieve a commercial accomplishment. In 2009, Shaft produced Bakemonogatari accomplishing the second highest DVD/BD sales of all time. And in 2011, it produced its new original anime Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica which brought another record-breaking success. Until 2016, it mainly produced Monogatari Series and 3 movies of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica among with RomCom animes such as Nisekoi. Also, Shaft produced an anime adaptation of popular music Mekaku City Actors, but left a poor result. In 2016, on 8th of January, it finally released the first part of 3-part movie Kizumonogatari!</blockquote>

    <div class="col-md-8 description">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <blockquote>Characteristic of Shaft is its avante garde film work and cinematography. Each cut is quick and switches rapidly. On the other hand, Shaft takes long shots and fixed frames between conversations. Furthermore, they actively uses text during each scenes and restrict appearances of extras and background characters. Shaft even use collage to present an abstract background in collaboration with Inu-Kare. Another characteristic worth mentioning is its distinctive head-tilt which has been popularized by its major productions. These film technique of Shaft studio form a grotesque and eccentric atmosphere. In addition, it has a tradition of placing an illustration at the end of each episode that forces the viewers to see the show until the end. Shaft’s idiosyncratic style is intriguing and compelling. However, because of this, it is a studio that is fitting for thriller, mystery and psychological works rather than works with bright and plain atmosphere. Another weaknesses is its time management and quality control. Due to its frequent tight scheduling, most of the errors in art of the TVA are edited and fixed in DVD/BD which often causes gap of quality between the aired version and re-made version on DVD. Shaft tends to cover these problems with its cinematography. Namely, repeated use of cuts filled with text and fixed frames. These weaknesses caused 4-year postponement of Kizumonogatari and horrifying opening of 9th episode of Mekakucity Actors. All in all, it is a production that has two extremes.</blockquote>

Then, it rose to its fame when it produced Fate/Zero which recorded the highest sales of the quarter. In 2014, they decided to make a re-make of Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works and was applauded by the fans of a popular visual novel Fate series. But, its standing crashed with the catastrophic production of GOD EATER. From the beginning, it postponed the first episode and instead replaced it with a 15-minute short title. Despite the postponement, the first episode was detested by the viewers and caused worries among the fans. This worry came to reality when ufotable was not able to keep up with the deadlines for 4th, 6th and 8th episode and announced to wrap up the series with 9 episode. Total failure of God Eater left a huge scar on ufotable’s reputation. Hopefully, God Eater was finished with the release of extra 4 episodes, but it seems that ufotable has a long way to go in order to recover its status and fame.</blockquote>

Its next original work Nagi no Asukara also showed a similar trend which brought financial concerns among the fans. However, the Movie Hanasaku Iroha ~HOME SWEET HOME~'s sales and as Nagi no Asukara brought some positive results, these worries faded.
