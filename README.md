# THE COLLECTOR

THE COLLECTOR is a personal anime gallery website I made for my own hobby. For anyone else who wants to use it, here are some
things that you might want to check out.
Here is the link to the website:

## **1. Optimized for Desktop**
  It was around 3 to 4 years ago that I created this webiste when I just started coding. Back then, I did not know how to optimize a
  website for mobile. Although I have attached a meta view tag to the html files, it is still recommended that you open it in a laptop
  for best user experience.

## **2. Gallery System**

  If you click on the gallery icon shown above which is attached each anime you will get a gallery of beautiful illustrations
  from the your favorite anime.

## **3. Info System**

  To check out some basic information about a certain anime, just click on one of the images. A panel will scroll down on your
  right, which will display the information about the anime. All of the information is taken from myanimelist.
  
## **4. Music Player**
  
  Once you enter the website, you may notice that some anime music starts playing. First, it will play any song at random,
  but if you want to listen to some music from a certain anime, just click on the title/text of the anime. It will refresh the
  song for you! Also, the music player I am using is customized from Jplayer. It supports, loops, volume, pause, play, and most of
  the basic functions for a music player. Enjoy!

## **5. Searcher**
  
  Having trouble finding a certain anime on the page? Well, go to the searcher on top and simply type the anime you want to find!
  It will autocomplete the name of the anime for you and scroll down to its position in just a second.
  
## **6. Recommendation System**

  You may have noticed this icon hovering on the bottom right of the page. Just click on the icon and it will load a new page for
  recommendations. There are few sections that I categorized for your custom recommendations!
  
  - ### Productions
  
    Like a certain anime Studio? Well, if you click on this section, it will show you all the major studios you might be interested in.
    It will show you the history, art-style, staffs... everything you need to know about the production to explore your taste for anime.
    
  - ### Anime of the season
  
    If you go to this section, you will encounter some of the new animes that I personally recommend seeing this season!
    Feel free to click on the info button to find more about the anime.
    
  - ### Theme
  
    If you are a fan of certain theme, I have organized a gallery where you can click on the title of the theme on the top-left
    corner of the screen to get some anime recommendations based on that!
  
  - ### Genres
  
    For people who might think my themes were too specific, I have organized another page so that you can find some recommendations
    by genre! You can click on the image carousel to get some info about the anime from myanimelist! The design of the page was
    inspired by Netflix's main page.
    
  - ### Best of Anime
  
    Some people may argue this, but I personally think these are the one of the best animes I have ever watched.
    Similar to Theme gallery, you can click on the titles of the anime to look at synopsis of the anime...
    No spoilers!
    
That is the introduction to my website and I hope you enjoy it if you happen to crash into it!
