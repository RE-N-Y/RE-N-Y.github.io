# THE COLLECTOR

THE COLLECTOR is a personal anime gallery website I made for my own hobby. For anyone else who wants to use it, here are some
things that you might want to check out.

## **1. Optimized for Desktop**
  It was around 3 to 4 years ago that I created this webiste when I just started coding. Back then, I did not know how to optimize a
  website for mobile. Although I have attached a meta view tag to the html files, it is still recommended that you open it in a laptop
  for best user experience.

## **2. Gallery System**

  from the your favorite anime.
